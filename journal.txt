The job posting I used is here: https://www.glassdoor.com/job-listing/developer-stream-9-JV_IC1145778_KO0,9_KE10,18.htm?jl=3042743460&ctt=1543871604285

I chose to learn Sass or sassy css.
It is a language that is compiled into css with a preprocessor.
This allows you to use things like variables inheritance and a few more programatic tricks to make writting css easier and more fun.

I wanted to use react because I like it it makes front end easy for me, and firebase hosting for easy https and quick deployment.

Create-react-app 2.0 now includes Sass preprocessing by default but you do need to install "node-sass" for it to work.
if you haven't installed it yet and you include sass in your project files you will be prompted with this message:

    To import Sass files, you first need to install node-sass.
    Run `npm install node-sass` or `yarn add node-sass` inside your workspace.

very straight forward installation and then all the information you need to implement Sass's features is right here:
    https://sass-lang.com/guide

In fact all I did in my code was use the features as detailed in this tutorial and then play around with it and try to break it/ make stuff look strange.

So to follow along if you open the _reset.scss file and the app.scss file I've explained what happens in the comments on each of those files. 
They really don't make sense without the code next to it so please look in those files to understand what is going on


Please note that if you've visited the URL provided before and you DON'T SEE A PINK SASS LOGO you need to CLEAR YOUR CACHE or load the page in an incognito tab/window
Enjoy the final product.

please look at the .scss files in my src folder to see the code that makes the css stuff happen!

Thanks for a great semester bye everyone!
